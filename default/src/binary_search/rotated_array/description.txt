Suppose a sorted array A is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

The array will not contain duplicates.

NOTE 1: Also think about the case when there are duplicates. Does your current solution work? How does the time complexity change?*
PROBLEM APPROACH:

Note: If you know the number of times the array is rotated, then this problem becomes trivial. If the number of rotation is x, then minimum element is A[x].
Lets look at how we can calculate the number of times the array is rotated.
